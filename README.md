## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Loan Default Dataset, containing detailed information about borrowers, including their financial status, loan characteristics, and payment behavior.


### Problem Description

Financial institutions face significant risks from loan defaults, which can impact profitability and long-term sustainability. Understanding the factors influencing loan defaults—such as borrower demographics, financial status, and loan characteristics—is critical for risk mitigation and informed lending decisions

### Dataset Information

 This dataset encompasses a range of insightful metrics:

- **LoanID :**  Unique identifier for each loan application
- **Age :** Applicant’s age in years
- **Income :** Monthly or annual income of the borrower
- **LoanAmount :** Total loan amount requested or approved
- **CreditScore :** Creditworthiness rating of the borrower
- **InterestRate  :** Interest charged on the loan
- **DTIRatio :** Debt-to-Income ratio indicating financial burden
- **MaritalStatus :** Applicant’s marital status (e.g., Single, Married)
- **EmploymentType  :** Job category or work status of applicant
- **Income Bracket :** Grouped income range category

### Background Information

As Instagram continues to shape online interactions, content creators, businesses, and influencers seek to decipher user preferences and optimize their strategies. This project is fueled by the realization that data-driven insights can guide content creation, enhance engagement, and facilitate audience growth. By studying engagement rates, post frequency, and other key indicators, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of the Instagram landscape.

## Project Objective

**The objective of this project was to analyze a Loan Default Dataset to:**

-Identify key patterns and trends in borrower behavior

-Understand how factors like employment type, credit score, income level, education, and marital status influence default risk

-Track loan performance metrics over time using YoY and YTD comparisons

-Provide actionable insights through interactive visual dashboards for business stakeholders and risk analysts

-This analysis enables data-driven decisions by highlighting high-risk borrower profiles and supporting more effective loan approval and monitoring strategies.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this Power BI project provided meaningful insights into loan default behavior by analyzing borrower demographics, financial status, and loan characteristics. The interactive dashboards revealed that factors such as employment type, credit score, and income bracket significantly influence default risk. Trends over time—captured through YoY and YTD metrics—highlighted changes in loan volumes and defaults, while demographic breakdowns exposed high-risk segments. The use of a decomposition tree further enhanced understanding of how income and employment jointly impact loan distributions. Overall, the project demonstrates how data visualization and business intelligence tools can support more informed, efficient, and strategic decision-making in the lending industry
